  <h1> Jonah Patinkin </h1>
  <p>
    To understand the self and ones abilities is a lifelong journey. I, Jonah Patinkin, have a passion for engineering and computer programming. It began as a child where i drew random objects for pleasure in hopes to discover how they work and how they were built. Growing up in the Chicago Suburbs of Skokie and Evanston illinois, I attended Evanston Township Highschool where i attended ever computer science related class they had to offer and started a drone building club known as flight club. Afterwards I went on to pursue a computer science degree at Illinois Institute of Technology.

    Growing up, I had a facination for how things work and how things were built. Whenever i got the chance i would draw random objects that facinated me on paper and i became insanley good at drawing as a result. This lead to an interest in the world of engineering and creativity.

    I became interested in computer programming after playing video games and wondering how i can make my own. It started where i discovered a program online called scratch and started to make random games and animations with it. Scratch allowed me to think programatically with visual scripting blocks which peace together to make things move around on the screen. Eventually i went on to making a few apps on the app store.
    <p>
    So far my interest in computer programming has lead me to puasue a degree in it. I'm currently a second year computer science student at Illinois Institute of technology. The things I have learned so far have taught me more about the world of computer programming and I hope to expand my knowledge and explore various trades within the world of computers.
