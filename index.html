  <h1> Jonah Patinkin </h1>
  <p>
    I'm a second year computer science student at Illinois Institute of technology. I started off on my programming journey in middle school where i became interested in making my own video games, and making interesting things happen on the screen. I became really involved in learning different programming languages like java and C++ and eventually decided to make a career out of it. So far i've made a few apps such as "dodge the drops", "tip the ship", and "popballoon" and hope to expand my journey in the world of computers.
